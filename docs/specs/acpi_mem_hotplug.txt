QEMU<->ACPI BIOS memory hotplug interface
--------------------------------------

ACPI BIOS GPE.3 handler is dedicated for notifying OS about memory hot-add
or hot-remove events.

Memory hot-plug interface (IO port 0xa00-0xa14, 1-4 byte access):
   - Accesses to memory hot-plug registers not documented
     below are ignored;
   - Ignored bits can return zero or one. When software reads a
     register with ignored bits, it masks off ignored bits prior
     to operating on the result. When software writes to a register
     with ignored bit fields, it preserves the ignored bit fields.
     (Ref: ACPI 5.0 spec, "Hardware Ignored Bits")
---------------------------------------------------------------
0xa00:
  read access:
      [0x0-0x3] Lo part of memory device phys address
      [0x4-0x7] Hi part of memory device phys address
      [0x8-0xb] Lo part of memory device size in bytes
      [0xc-0xf] Hi part of memory device size in bytes
      [0x10-0x13] Memory device proximity to NUMA node
      [0x14] Memory device status fields
          bits:
              0: device is present/enabled and may be used by guest.
              1: device insert event, used by ACPI BIOS to distinguish
                 device for which no device check event to OSPM was issued,
                 bit is valid only if bit 0 is set.

  write access:
      [0x0-0x3] Memory device slot selector, selects active memory device.
                All following accesses to other memory hot-plug registers
                will read/store data from/to selected memory device.
                Selecting memory device slot beyond available range has no
                effect. Available range is comunicated to BIOS by other
                means (in this impl. via dynamically build MDNR variable
                in SSDT table)
      [0x4-0x7] OST event code reported by OSPM.
      [0x8-0xb] OST status code reported by OSPM.
      [0x14] Memory device control fields
          bits:
              1: if set to 1 clears device insert event. Set by ACPI BIOS
                 after it has sent device check event to OSPM for
                 selected memory device.
