QEMU<->ACPI BIOS memory hotplug interface
--------------------------------------

ACPI BIOS GPE.3 handler is dedicated for notifying OS of memory hot-add
or hot-remove events. Read-only.

Memory Dimm hot-plug interface (IO port 0xaf80-0xaf97, 1-4 byte access):
---------------------------------------------------------------
0xaf80:
  read access:
      [0x0-0x3] Lo part of memory device phys address
      [0x4-0x7] Hi part of memory device phys address
      [0x8-0xb] Lo part of memory device size in bytes
      [0xc-0xf] Hi part of memory device size in bytes
      [0x14] Memory hot-plug interface version
      [0x15] Memory device status fields
          bits:
              1: device is enabled, end may be used by guest code
              2: device insert event, used by ACPI BIOS to distinguish
                 device for which no device check event to OSPM was issued
      [0x16-0x17] reserved

  write access:
      [0x0-0x3] Memory device slot selector, selects active memory device.
                All following accesses to other registers in 0xaf80-0xaf97
                region will read/store data from/to selected memory device.
      [0x4-0x7] OST event code reported by OSPM
      [0x8-0xb] OST status code reported by OSPM
      [0x15] Memory device status fields
          bits:
              2: if set to 1 clears device insert event, set by ACPI BIOS
                 after it has sent device check event to OSPM for
                 seleted memory device

Selecting memory device slot beyond present range has no effect on platform:
   - following write access to memory hot-plug registers except of
     [0x0-0x3] is ignored;
   - following read access to memory hot-plug registers returns 0
